This is a database of all mime types.
<<<<<<< HEAD
It consists of a single, public JSON file and does not include any logic,
allowing it to remain as un-opinionated as possible with an API.

It aggregates data from the following sources:

- http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml
- http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types
<<<<<<< HEAD
- http://hg.nginx.org/nginx/raw-file/default/conf/mime.types

## Installation

```bash
npm install mime-db
```

### Database Download

If you're crazy enough to use this in the browser, you can just grab the
JSON file using [RawGit](https://rawgit.com/). It is recommended to replace
`master` with [a release tag](https://github.com/jshttp/mime-db/tags) as the
JSON format may change in the future.

## Data Structure

The JSON file is a map lookup for lowercased mime types.
Each mime type has the following properties:

- `.source` - where the mime type is defined.
    If not set, it's probably a custom media type.
    - `apache` - [Apache common media types](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types)
    - `iana` - [IANA-defined media types](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)
<<<<<<< HEAD
    - `nginx` - [nginx media types](http://hg.nginx.org/nginx/raw-file/default/conf/mime.types)
=======
>>>>>>> 577a2527b30699446785b62d07097a35f051d5ce
- `.extensions[]` - known extensions associated with this mime type.
- `.compressible` - whether a file of this type is can be gzipped.
- `.charset` - the default charset associated with this type, if any.

If unknown, every property could be `undefined`.

To edit the database, only make PRs against `src/custom.json` or
`src/custom-suffix.json`.

To update the build, run `npm run update`.

## Adding Custom Media Types

The best way to get new media types included in this library is to register
them with the IANA. The community registration procedure is outlined in
[RFC 6838 section 5](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6838#section-5). Types
registered with the IANA are automatically pulled into this library.

## Repository Structure

- `scripts` - these are scripts to run to build the database
- `src/` - this is a folder of files created from remote sources like Apache and IANA
- `lib/` - this is a folder of our own custom sources and db, which will be merged into `db.json`
- `db.json` - the final built JSON file for end-user usage

## Contributing

To edit the database, only make PRs against files in the `lib/` folder.
To update the build, run `npm run update`.
