Introducing session sharing via JS store improved performance to 170%
in a single-process no-concurrency scenario. The difference is neglilible with 
10 concurrent connections.

NULL-MD5 ciphers seems to be slower that TLSv1/SSLv3 defaults.

TLS in a cluster is much slower compared to single-worker setup in
no-concurrency scenario: TLsv1 -65%, SSLv3 -55%

Higher number of cluster workers does not improve TLS connect performance.

Utilization of CPU remains low - approx. 10-25% user, 5-15% system

Before adding a write to both client and server connections, TLSv1 was clearly
the fastest option. After adding a write, SSLv3 with session sharing is fastest
for concurrency=10. TLSv1 is faster again for concurrency=100vim.
